Most télévisions are made in a manière to please the general public. For that raison, tout you see on the télévision had the bords cut, haut, bas and côtés. This is made to ensure that l'image covers the whole écran. That is called l'overscan. Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, its bords will most likely be coupés too, and if the vidéo had sous-titres too close to the bas, they won't be fully shown."

This is becoming less of a problématique as fabricants de lentilles achieve higher normes in production de lentilles. This has allowed objectifs zoom to produce images of a qualité comparable to that achieved by lenses with fixed longueur focale. Another inconvénient of objectifs zoom is that the maximum ouverture (the vitesse) of the lens is usually lower. This makes inexpensive objectifs zoom hard to use in low-light conditions without a flash.
