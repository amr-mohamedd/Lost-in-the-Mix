The main 原因 for this 现象 is the 结果 of the lucid dreams expanding the 长度 of 时间 between REM 状态. With fewer 快速眼动期 per 夜, this 状态 in which you experience actual 睡眠 and your 身体 recovers becomes infrequent enough to become a 问题. This is just as exhausting as if you were to wake up every twenty or thirty 分钟 and watch 电视. The 效果 is dependent on how often your 大脑 attempts to lucidly dream per night."
